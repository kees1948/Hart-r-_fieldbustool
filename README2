Hello

This is the second release of my toolset. (2015-06-22)

All is released under GPL V3 or later. Please leave the Copyright info intact.

hart_master: 

master,

replaced usleep() by nanosleep(), as the latter seems to perform better 

can now be build _without_ the MySQL database requirement, 
instead it can use a table-file with the request/response frame definitions.
This can be advantageous for stand-alone applications i.e. Raspberyy Pi.

Build options are (Hart.h): 
* with database AND table option, 
* with database only
* with table option only.

hmt_config, 

should be renamed/copied to .hmt_config, preferably in the user home
directory. Fill in the items or comment them out with '#' at the first
position in the line. 

test_tools:

usleep_test, test the performance of usleep() and nanosleep() on the platform
I had a kernel once where the timing was off by factor 4......

hartcmdline, scripting helper. See Script_Example1 (Perl) 

harttestframe, test scripting helper. See DLL011.pl and DLL013.pl. 
needs an accurate control of the modem, use RS232 type modem with /dev/ttyS? 
or with /dev/ttyUSB? type ports. Be in for surprises on how some USB<->Serial
dongles may fool you. A device as the USB Viator is unsuitable here.
Note that the DLL011.pl and DLL013.pl script wait for a CR from the keyboard
before the next testcycle is executed...

database tools:

harttooldb, simple Perl tool to maintain the MySQL database. 
the -U option allows you to maintain the Universal/Common Practice commands.
the -S option will retain some fields in harttooldb to be re-used for the
next operation instead of erasing them.

hartsql2table.pl, Perl tool to convert an exported MySQL database into 
a tablefile (hmt_tablefile)

hmt_table, simple text table. Take care to maintain the proper format.
BEWARE! For device specific commands it is important to have the correct
value in the device type field! Otherwise master may not be able to 
handle the commands correctly. 
For command-commands create an entry with req and rsp at 0 but with a size at 1.

Hart.sql, example of exported MySQL database, here with Universal and some
Common Practice commands. If you wan to use a MySQL database, Hart.sql can
be used for import.

General:

Most of the tools use usleep() or nanosleep() for their timing, therefore
it is important that these functions  work accurate.

Perl: I use a couple of Perl modules that you may need to add with 'cpan'.

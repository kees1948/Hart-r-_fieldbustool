*** corrections for master build (2015-07-20)

Modified Hart.h, ProcessFrames.c, Main.c and the Makefile to control the build 
from the Makefile. Before it still tried to link with libmysqlclient, even when you
attempted to build the tablefile version only.

Furthermore I changed hmt_config to be a tablefile vesion only, commented out the
database references by default.

When I was developping a Hart(r) slave I needed a tool that was capable of emulating a Hart master. I had to be
able to repeatitly issueing commands with short interval. It had to obey the timings on a FSK type connection
and be interoperable with burst mode devices. This all in a Xterm on Linux.

The resulting hart_master tool does all that!

It can be invoked as the primary master
It can be invoked as the secundary master
It can be invoked as a burst mode listener
It can be invoked as a logging tool
